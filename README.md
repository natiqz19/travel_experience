# travel_experience
A classification use case on passengers travel experience; whether a passenger is satisfied or unsatisfied.

- This project has been undertaken under a Data Science course Hackhathon. Thus, the dataset is not being shared hereby.

- The goal of the use case is to perform prediction whether a passenger is satisfied or not with his/her travel experience in the Shinkansen Bullet Train. The field to predict is the Overall_Experience from the Survey data collected.

- This use case is a Classification problem with binary Target class (**Overall_Experience = 0: Unsatisfied, 1: Satisfied**). There are 2 sets of input data: The **Survey data & the train Travel data**.

- The project implements the standard Data Mining practice e.g. Data Exploration, Data Processing, handling of missing values, Data Preparation for Modeling, and tests out a few Machine Learning algorithms in order to obtain the best model with the best accuracy to predict Customers Satisfaction.

- The best model achieved is the Random Forest model at 95.2% accuracy
